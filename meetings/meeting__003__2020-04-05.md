title: "Achim // Processing x ml5 Fellowship // Meeting #3"
---

- COVID-19 is significant disruption w/r/t original proposal of running workshops. I was waiting to see whether things calm down, but now it seems reasonable to completely reconsider deliverable's form.
- Listing up ML educational resources in Korean https://www.are.na/achim-koh/slash-jw3aahyvfaw
- Opentutorials, a community/collection of great openly-available coding courses, is also launching an ML course, which I think will be complimentary to what I am trying to do
- Context review (blog post): 4/15
- PoC (one introductory content): 4/29. This will establish the baseline of what I want to deliver- how to use ml5js, key concepts to understand, etc.
