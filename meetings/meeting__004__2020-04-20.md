ml5js check-in w/ joey, 4/20

- spent time on lots of parallel stuff, like applying for grants and space support- not essential to fellowship project but time-sensitive (COVID-19 relief) so that's been going on
- not much progress in terms of writing and building material- still working on rationale blog post. will have it end of week.
- still aiming for proof of concept at start of may.
- but think it makes sense to delay end of fellowship by one month or so.
