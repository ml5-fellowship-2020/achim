> Critical Machine Learning with ml5.js will be a series of **educational material** that enables a critical understanding and use of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a focus on the social implications of said technologies. The material will be produced in Korean and English, for local usage and broader access.
The developed material will be activated through a series of workshops in Seoul. The workshops will be accompanied by a discussion-oriented event around critical perspectives on software, ML, and AI. All events aim at fostering a more inclusive environment in the Korean tech context.
The project is partly a response to industry- and government-driven AI initiatives, which typically cast AI-related education as vocational, as previous coding education initiatives tended to do with software programming. Ultimately, this work intends to build resources that help people think critically about technology, power, and knowledge.

## Goals

- critical understanding of ML, knowledge, technology, and power
- focusing on social implications of ML
- materials in Korean and English
- create a more inclusive environment in korean tech context

## Outcomes

- Educational Materials in Korean and English
    - define:
        - educational materials - what form?
        - audience - younger gen? 50 and over? The audience doesn't have to be defined now, but good to have in mind in case there's a specific target
- Workshops in Seoul
- Discussion-oriented event featuring speakers

## Tones and Moodboard

- Alarmist / Shock value?
- Ambivalence?

## Potential Form Factors

- website
- workbook
- zine
- Social media platform
- video series
- interactive exercises
- How to translate those examples to a more personal level?

## Action Items

- [ ]  Project Management:
    - [ ]  Create a project timeline / Grannt Chart: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart)
        - [ ]  Think of things as maybe phases?
    - [ ]  Look into CMS for localization and multi language support:
        - [ ]  Docusaurus: [https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/translation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/translation)
        - [ ]  Gatsby Localization: [https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/localization-i18n/](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/localization-i18n/)
    - [ ]  Make a github organization for the materials
- [ ]  Concept:
    - [ ]  Literature review / problem definition: Specific interest points would be to think about korean tech context. What is the state of ML education and engagement in Korea. Set the stage for what it looks like there for us - maybe written up as a blog post?
- [ ]  Things I'm thinking about:
    - [ ]  Things will take basically 2x as long for translated materials - does it make sense to focus on korean materials first, then (if there's time) translate to english? Just want to be realistic about timing + make sure that the korean context is forefronted in the work.
    - [ ]  Any asks or things I can do to help? Whether infrastructure related or conceptually?
