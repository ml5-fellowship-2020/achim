ml5js meeting w/ joey

schedule/timeframe?
prob. can start producing something from april
one or two topics + activations per month realistic. (when thinking of 2-hr workshop)

covid19 -> offline events uncertain
might need to youtube, etc

planning to talk with organizer of last year's pcd seoul (w&t lab)
+ this year's other Korean fellows
-> online event, maybe

preparing latent space newsletter
-> preliminary research on what ppl are out there in seoul/korea, etc

possible topic: 
- image/face recognition techniques and korean beauty's influence on young women 
- what does it mean that ai can be creative (e.g. text generation) 
- data, labor, capitalism, knowledge, computing infrastructure 
- primer; models and abstractions 
- online violence / harassment (text classification)
- 취업 면접(영상), 이력서(텍스트)

- "bad/evil" machine learning, and how to disrupt algorithmic systems (e.g. using adversarial examples)
really want to think about some 'counter-optimizing' method (cf. francis tseng) 

- ai systems as systemic oppression and its legitimization
- ai systems - how does it shift power? from whom to whom?
e.g. hate speech detection - good work, but also a way to evade more critical and fundamental questions of accountability
facial recognition, obviously
- ai systems are corporate technology
- reconceptualizing labor
- counter-optimizing (francis tseng)
- environmental exploitation, labor exploitation
- deceptive surveillance, transparency, overpromising
- non-binarism, anti-bias, anti-monolinguism, inclusion
- people's agency
- disability, accessible education
- citizenship / literacy vs accountability / systemic checks
- education + research dissemination + community building

glitch + ml5.js?

reverted cone approach / simpsons approach
top/surface level: fun, stuff that ppl can get sth out of, even if they only participate shortly or superficially
deep, end-goals can be placed deeper 
(so that as to embrace as broad an audience as possible. everyone gets at least something)


priority on lots of documentations, blog posts, etc (than a very elaborate project per se)
low-stakes stuff
invitation for engagement. hello world! (and hello korea!) (250 words)

phase 1: (next two weeks)
project management setup, rough timeline, etc
literature review

phase 2:
proof of concept (maybe a video in korean?)
